and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.20...HEAD)

### Added

- **`conductor preview`** — open the web dashboard showing a workflow's DAG
  (agents, routes, parallel/for-each groups) without executing it. The
  workflow is validated first (same checks as `conductor validate`), then the
  dashboard is seeded with its topology; no agents run and no provider calls
  are made. The dashboard renders the graph statically with a
  "Preview — not running" status instead of a live run. `type: workflow`
  subworkflow agents can be drilled into recursively too, the same as during
  a real run (not supported for a `type: workflow` agent inline in a
  `for_each` group, since its dashboard node only exists once the group's
  `source` is resolved against real input).
- Node detail panels in the web dashboard now show each node's static YAML
  configuration (prompt/system_prompt/tools, script command/args/working_dir,
  wait duration, human_gate options, set value(s), subworkflow path, terminate
  status/reason) independent of run state — previously a pending node's panel
  was nearly empty until it actually ran. Also adds a dedicated detail view
  for `type: terminate` steps (previously showed nothing type-specific).
  `script.env` values are never sent to the dashboard, only key names, since
  `env:` blocks commonly carry resolved secrets.

## [0.1.20](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.19...v0.1.20) - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Hermes provider (experimental)** — optional third provider built on the
  NousResearch [`hermes-agent`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)
  library, which manages its own tool ecosystem (no MCP configuration). Install
  separately with `pip install hermes-agent`; Conductor works without it.
  Declared in the experimental provider tier with documented capability
  carve-outs (no MCP servers, no per-agent workflow `tools:` allowlist,
  structured output via prompt injection). Supports custom endpoints via
  structured `runtime.provider` (`base_url` / `api_key`), `hermes_home`
  profiles, `hermes_toolsets`, streaming + reasoning event callbacks,
  cooperative interrupt, session-history resume, and `max_session_seconds`.
  See [`docs/providers/hermes.md`](docs/providers/hermes.md).
  ([#235](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/235))
- **Cost budget enforcement** — set a USD ceiling for a run with
  `runtime.budget_usd` and choose how the engine reacts via `runtime.budget_mode`:
  `audit` (default — track spend and warn as the cap is approached) or `enforce`
  (stop the run once the projected cost would exceed the cap). Off by default — no
  budget tracking happens unless `budget_usd` is set.
  ([#212](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/212))
- **External-workflow friction improvements** — four knobs that surfaced while
  running real-world workflows: per-agent `output_mode` (`raw` | `envelope`) for
  cross-provider output-shape parity; `retry.max_parse_recovery_attempts` to cap
  the in-session JSON-correction prompts sent when an agent's output fails to
  parse; a new `conductor gate-respond --port <port> --choice <value>` command to
  resolve a human gate from the CLI (handy for `--web` / `--web-bg` runs); and
  more robust Windows path handling.
  ([#234](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/234))
- **Templated `reasoning.effort` and `context_tier`** — both per-agent fields now
  accept Jinja2 templates (e.g. `effort: "{{ workflow.input.eff }}"`) resolved at
  runtime against the workflow context, instead of being rejected at YAML load as
  invalid enum literals. The rendered value is re-validated against the allowed
  set. ([#263](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/263),
  closes [#262](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/262))
- **Scoped `applyTo` instruction loading** — `.github/instructions/*.md` files
  with a scoped `applyTo` glob (e.g. `**/*.cs`, `services/foo/**`) are now loaded
  when their scope overlaps the run's working directory, instead of being silently
  dropped unless `applyTo: "**"`. Multi-glob values separated by `;` or `,` are
  supported, and the closest-owning convention directory wins for nested
  instruction files.
  ([#238](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/238),
  closes [#231](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/231))

### Fixed

- **Copilot model attribution for auto-routed runs** — when an agent uses
  `model: auto`, `AgentOutput.model` now records the concrete model the Copilot
  SDK resolved to (captured from the `assistant.usage` event) instead of the
  literal string `"auto"`, so token usage and cost are attributed to the real
  model. ([#268](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/268))
- **claude-agent-sdk default tool preset** — an agent that omits `tools:` on the
  `claude-agent-sdk` provider again receives the full `claude_code` preset instead
  of zero tools. The omitted-vs-empty distinction (`tools:` absent means "all
  tools"; `tools: []` means "none") was being lost at the executor→provider
  boundary whenever the workflow declared no MCP tools.
  ([#269](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/269))

## [0.1.19](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.18...v0.1.19) - 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Context tier** — new `context_tier` knob (`default` | `long_context`) to
  select a model's long-context (e.g. 1M-token) window on the Copilot provider.
  Set per agent via `context_tier:` (sibling to `model`) or workflow-wide via
  `runtime.default_context_tier`; the per-agent value wins. It composes
  independently with `reasoning.effort` (the two map to separate
  `create_session` kwargs). The Copilot provider forwards the resolved value as
  `context_tier` to `create_session`; other providers ignore it. Only valid on
  standard `agent`-type agents (rejected on `script`, `human_gate`, and
  `workflow` agents). See [`examples/context-tier.yaml`](examples/context-tier.yaml)
  and [Context Tier](docs/configuration.md#context-tier).
  ([#251](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/251))
- **Validator block** — an optional `validator:` block on provider-backed
  agents that runs a second LLM call to grade the agent's output against a
  user-defined rubric. Distinct from `retry:` (transient failures, same
  prompt) and `output:` (shape/type): it catches structurally valid but
  semantically wrong, incomplete, or off-rubric output. Fields: `criteria`
  (required), `model` (defaults to the agent's model), and `max_retries`
  (`0` or `1`, default `1`, hard-capped at `1`). On `passed: false` the agent
  re-runs **once** with the validator's issues appended under a
  `## Validation feedback` section; the second output is final (no second
  validation loop). Validation is **fail-open** — grader errors or unparseable
  responses are logged and treated as a pass, so a hung or broken grader can't
  block the workflow. Wired into the main loop, parallel groups, and for-each
  loops; emits `agent_validator_start` / `agent_validator_complete` /
  `agent_validation_failed` events surfaced in `--verbose` console output and
  the web dashboard, and records the grading call (plus any discarded first
  attempt) as a separate `<agent> (validator)` usage row. Rejected on
  `script` / `human_gate` / `workflow` / `wait` / `set` / `terminate` steps.
  See [`examples/validator.yaml`](examples/validator.yaml) and the
  [Validator section](docs/workflow-syntax.md) of the workflow syntax docs.
  ([#256](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/256),
  closes [#220](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/220))
- **Periodic / milestone checkpoints** — opt-in `runtime.checkpoint` block that
  saves a resumable checkpoint at step boundaries so a long run that stalls or
  is hard-killed stays recoverable (previously Conductor only checkpointed on
  failure). Two OR-combined triggers — `every_agent: true` (save at every step
  boundary) and `every_seconds: N` (a throttle: save at the first boundary once
  `N` seconds have elapsed since the last checkpoint) — plus `keep_last`
  (default `5`) to rotate older periodic checkpoints per run. Off by default, so
  failure-only behaviour is preserved. Periodic checkpoints are scoped to their
  own run and trigger, so failure checkpoints and other runs' files are never
  rotated away, and they are cleaned up automatically on clean completion or an
  explicit `terminate`. A failed periodic save emits a `checkpoint_save_failed`
  event (console + JSONL + dashboard) so a recovery-reliant run is never left
  silently without checkpoints, and `conductor checkpoints` gains a `Trigger`
  column. See
  [`examples/periodic-checkpoints.yaml`](examples/periodic-checkpoints.yaml)
  and the [Periodic Checkpoints section](docs/workflow-syntax.md) of the
  workflow syntax docs.
  ([#255](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/255),
  closes [#244](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/244))
- **Script `stdin:` payload transport** — `type: script` steps accept a new
  `stdin:` field: a Jinja2 string template rendered against the workflow
  context and piped to the child process on stdin as UTF-8. Workflows can now
  hand large or structured payloads to scripts without hitting command-line
  length limits (notably Windows, which caps the command line at ~32 KB),
  removing argument-name-specific temp-file workarounds. `stdin` and `args` are
  orthogonal; an explicit empty string pipes an immediate EOF, and omitting it
  preserves the legacy behaviour of inheriting the parent's stdin. The payload
  is streamed in the background so multi-MB inputs can't deadlock, the submitted
  byte count is surfaced as `stdin_bytes` on the `script_completed` event, and
  an unencodable payload raises a named `ExecutionError`. Rejected on every
  non-script step type. See
  [`examples/script-stdin.yaml`](examples/script-stdin.yaml).
  ([#253](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/253),
  refs [#18](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/18))
- **Experimental provider tier** — providers that delegate part of the agentic
  loop to an upstream SDK can now declare an *experimental* stability tier with
  explicit, allowed capability carve-outs instead of silently eroding provider
  parity. Every provider declares a class-level `CAPABILITIES`
  (`ProviderCapabilities`) descriptor, and `conductor validate` cross-checks
  workflow features against each agent's resolved provider — surfacing silent
  mismatches (unsupported `runtime.mcp_servers`, non-empty per-agent `tools:`
  allowlists, `reasoning.effort`, structured `output:`, concurrent use in
  parallel/for-each groups, `max_session_seconds`) at validate time rather than
  at runtime. The `workflow_started` event gains a `providers` block (tier,
  upstream pin, maintainer, full capability dump) plus a `provider_name` per
  agent; the CLI prints a one-time banner per experimental provider per run, and
  the web dashboard renders a yellow "exp" badge on affected agent nodes. See
  [Experimental Providers](docs/providers/experimental.md).
  ([#242](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/242),
  closes [#241](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/241))
- **`claude-agent-sdk` provider** — a new, experimental provider that delegates
  the agentic loop, tool execution, and structured-output extraction to the
  Claude Code CLI via the `claude-agent-sdk` package. Unlike the raw `claude`
  provider it does not manage its own retry logic, MCP servers, or tool wiring —
  the SDK runtime owns those. It achieves event and output parity
  (`agent_turn_start`, `agent_message`, `agent_reasoning`,
  `agent_tool_start` / `agent_tool_complete`, and the standard `AgentOutput`
  shape), pairing real `ToolResultBlock` results rather than emitting nulls.
  Workflow-level `runtime.mcp_servers`, non-empty per-agent `tools:` lists, and
  `temperature` / `max_tokens` are rejected at the factory (the CLI controls
  these). Install with the optional extra
  (`pip install conductor[claude-agent-sdk]`) plus the `claude` CLI. See
  [`examples/experimental-claude-agent-sdk.yaml`](examples/experimental-claude-agent-sdk.yaml).
  ([#104](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/104))

### Fixed

- Web dashboard **Stop/Kill now always writes a checkpoint** (or clearly
  explains why it couldn't). Previously, killing a run while an agent was
  actively executing — or clicking Stop during the brief startup window before
  the engine bound its interrupt event — cancelled the engine task from the CLI
  wrapper, bypassing the engine's failure handling so **no checkpoint and no
  `workflow_failed` event** were produced and progress was silently lost. Now:
  - A dashboard stop that cancels the engine routes through a best-effort
    checkpoint + `workflow_failed`/`checkpoint_saved` emit
    (`WorkflowEngine.handle_dashboard_stop`), so the run is resumable with
    `conductor resume`.
  - `POST /api/stop` during startup is **queued** until the interrupt event is
    bound (graceful pause path) instead of falling back to a hard cancel.
  - The dashboard shows a dedicated, calm **"Workflow Stopped"** banner with
    `Checkpoint saved: <path>` — or `No checkpoint could be saved — <reason>`
    when one genuinely couldn't be written — instead of an alarming red
    "Workflow Failed". ([#245](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/245))
- `human_gate` agents: the dict returned by `prompt_for` text-collection fields
  is no longer spread into the gate's output root, where it could silently
  overwrite the reserved `selected` key (e.g. an option declaring
  `prompt_for: selected` would clobber the chosen option value with whatever
  the user typed). Collected values are now nested under an explicit
  `additional_input` key, matching the shape the `gate_resolved` event already
  used. ([#237](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/237))
- `context: explicit` mode now supports **nested output projection** in
  `input:` declarations. References of the form
  `agent_name.output.field.subfield...` (and the
  `agent_name.field.subfield...` shorthand) project arbitrarily deep into a
  prior step's structured output, where previously only a single level
  (`agent_name.output.field`) resolved and deeper paths silently failed.
  Optional refs (`?`) skip missing intermediate paths, and projected leaves are
  deep-copied to avoid mutation aliasing. Static validation in
  `conductor validate` was aligned with the runtime so valid nested references
  no longer fail validation.
  ([#239](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/239))

### Changed

- **BREAKING (templates)** — `human_gate` output shape changed.
  - Before: `{{ <gate>.output.<prompt_for_field> }}` (root-level).
  - After: `{{ <gate>.output.additional_input.<prompt_for_field> }}` (nested).
  - Gates without any `prompt_for` now produce `additional_input: {}` rather
    than just `{"selected": ...}` — the key is always present.
  - `<gate>.output.selected` is unchanged.
  - Templates that referenced the old flat path now raise `TemplateError`
    (`StrictUndefined`), so the migration fails loudly rather than rendering
    to empty strings.
  - In `context: explicit` mode, `input:` declarations can reference either
    `<gate>.output.additional_input` (the whole dict) or an individual
    `<gate>.output.additional_input.<field>`. Nested explicit-input projection
    landed in this same release
    ([#239](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/239)), so the dotted
    field path now resolves directly; you can also still declare the parent and
    read individual fields via Jinja2 in the consuming agent's prompt or output
    template.

## [0.1.18](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.17...v0.1.18) - 2026-05-28

### Added
- New `type: set` workflow step that evaluates Jinja2 expressions and binds
  the results into the workflow context — no LLM call, no subprocess, no I/O.
  Two surface forms: `value:` (single expression bound as `<step>.output`,
  scalar / list / dict by auto-detection or explicit `output_type:`) and
  `values:` (named bindings rendered in one pass against the pre-step context
  and bound as `<step>.output.<key>`). Type detection defaults to YAML
  auto-parsing with a JSON-safety pass that converts `datetime`/`date`/`time`
  to ISO 8601 strings and raises `ExecutionError` on other non-JSON-safe
  values (including non-string dict keys) so checkpoint round-trips stay
  stable. Explicit `output_type:` (single-`value` only) supports `string`,
  `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `list`, `dict`. The engine dispatches set
  steps in the main loop, parallel groups, and for-each groups via the
  shared `_run_set_step` helper, emitting `set_started` / `set_completed` /
  `set_failed` and enforcing the `output:` schema (rejected for scalar
  outputs with a friendly suggestion). `WorkflowContext.store` was widened
  to accept any JSON-safe value; `_add_agent_input` returns scalars verbatim
  for `step.output` and raises a clear `KeyError` for `step.output.field`
  shorthand on non-dict outputs. The web dashboard adds a dedicated `SetNode`
  (variable icon, key count / value preview) and `SetDetail` panel showing
  output type, bindings, and rendered value. New `examples/set-step.yaml`
  demonstrates single + multi binding plus a boolean route on the derived
  flag
  ([#226](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/226),
  closes [#221](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/221)).
- New `type: wait` workflow step that pauses execution for a parsed
  duration via in-process `asyncio.sleep`. Cross-platform — no shell
  `sleep` dependency. Use for rate-limit cooldowns, polling intervals,
  external-system catch-up, and demos. The `duration:` field accepts
  plain numbers (seconds), suffixed strings (`"500ms"`, `"60s"`,
  `"2.5m"`, `"1h"`), or a Jinja2 template that renders to one of
  those (e.g. `"{{ workflow.input.poll_interval }}s"`). Schema enforces
  `0 < duration <= 24h` and rejects boolean values pre-coercion.
  `Esc` / `Ctrl+G` cancels in-progress waits immediately (the engine
  races the sleep against the interrupt event), and the workflow-level
  `limits.timeout_seconds` also cancels them. Wait steps emit
  `wait_started` / `wait_completed` / `wait_failed` events alongside
  the generic `agent_started` (with `agent_type: "wait"`), so existing
  dashboards keyed on agent lifecycle pick them up automatically. The
  dashboard adds a dedicated `WaitNode` (clock icon) and `WaitDetail`
  panel that show the requested duration, actual elapsed time, reason,
  and an "interrupted" indicator. The public output contract is strict
  — only `{"waited_seconds": float}` is exposed to workflow context;
  extra metadata lives in event payloads. Wait steps count toward
  `limits.max_iterations` (each pause is one step) but are not subject
  to `max_agent_iterations` (per-LLM-agent tool counter). Wait cannot
  be used inside `parallel` or `for_each` groups. New `examples/wait-step.yaml`
  demonstrates a polling pattern with a templated poll interval and
  route loop-back
  ([#224](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/224),
  closes [#218](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/218)).
- New `type: terminate` workflow step that explicitly ends the workflow with
  a structured `status` (`success` | `failed`) and Jinja2-rendered `reason`,
  plus an optional `output_template` (`dict[str, str]`) that replaces the
  workflow-level `output:` mapping for that termination path. Reaching a
  terminate step ends the workflow immediately (no routes evaluated after).
  `status: success` returns the rendered output cleanly (CLI exit 0,
  dashboard ✅, emits `workflow_completed { termination_reason, terminated_by,
  is_explicit: true, status: "success" }`); `status: failed` raises a new
  `WorkflowTerminated` exception (`ExecutionError` subclass), gives the CLI a
  non-zero exit code while still printing the rendered output JSON to stdout
  for downstream tooling, and intentionally **skips** the on-failure
  checkpoint save because explicit termination is not a resumable transient
  failure. Inside a sub-workflow, a failed terminate is downgraded at the
  parent boundary to a new `SubworkflowTerminatedError` (also an
  `ExecutionError`) preserving the child's rendered `terminated_output` /
  `terminated_reason` / `terminated_by` as structured attributes, so the
  parent treats it as a normal sub-workflow failure (its own
  `workflow_failed` does NOT inherit `is_explicit: true`) while debugging
  surfaces can still inspect what the child intended to emit. Schema
  validation rejects `routes`, `tools`, `output`, `prompt`, `model`,
  `provider`, and the other agent-only fields on terminate steps, and
  conversely rejects `status` / `reason` / `output_template` on every other
  step type so authors who forget `type: terminate` get a clear error
  instead of silently dropped fields. Terminate cannot be used as a
  parallel-group member or as a `for_each` inline agent — route to one
  from those groups' `routes:` instead. The example workflow lives at
  `examples/terminate.yaml`
  ([#219](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/219)).
- `runtime.provider` now accepts either the bare string shorthand
  (`provider: copilot`) or a structured `ProviderSettings` object that
  forwards a `ProviderConfig` to the Copilot SDK's
  `create_session(provider=…)` parameter. This lets workflows route the
  Copilot SDK at OpenAI-compatible / Azure / Anthropic endpoints —
  Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, Azure OpenAI, llamafile, or any other
  OpenAI-compatible REST endpoint — instead of being locked to the
  GitHub Copilot service. The structured form supports `name`, `type`
  (`openai`|`azure`|`anthropic`), `wire_api`
  (`completions`|`responses`), `base_url`, `api_key`, `bearer_token`,
  `headers`, and `azure.api_version`. `api_key` and `bearer_token` are
  Pydantic `SecretStr` (redacted in `model_dump`, dashboard payloads,
  event logs, and checkpoints). Custom routing activates only when YAML
  sets at least one non-`name` field — ambient `OPENAI_*` env vars
  never divert default routing on their own. Once activated, missing
  fields fall back from `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` → `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
  for `base_url`, `COPILOT_PROVIDER_API_KEY` for `api_key`, and
  `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BEARER_TOKEN` for `bearer_token`. Ambient
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` is intentionally NOT consulted as an implicit
  fallback (credential-leak risk); use `api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`
  YAML interpolation for explicit opt-in. The schema rejects every
  non-`name` field when `name != "copilot"` (structured config for
  Claude / openai-agents is a follow-up), and rejects anchorless or
  empty combinations (`wire_api` / `type` / `headers` / `azure` alone,
  empty `headers`, empty `SecretStr`, empty `azure` block) so silent
  no-ops cannot reach the SDK. Custom routing applies to both agent
  execution and dialog turns so all sessions hit the same endpoint.
  See `examples/copilot-local-llm.yaml` and
  [Configuration → Custom Provider Routing](docs/configuration.md#custom-provider-routing-ollama--vllm--azure-openai)
  ([#225](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/225),
  [#136](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/136)).

### Added
- New `output_mode` field on `AgentDef` (`raw` | `envelope`). Setting
  `output_mode: raw` bypasses JSON schema injection and parse-recovery entirely,
  wrapping the model's response as `{"result": "<text>"}`. Useful for agents
  that produce large Markdown, prose, or code output that should not be
  JSON-extracted. `output_mode: raw` is incompatible with `output:` — declaring
  both raises a `ValidationError` at config load time.
- New `max_parse_recovery_attempts` field on `RetryPolicy` (YAML `retry:`
  block, per-agent or workflow-level). Overrides the provider default (Copilot:
  5, Claude: 2) for agents that need tighter or looser in-session parse-recovery
  budgets. Accepts integer 0–10; `0` disables all recovery attempts and lets
  the first parse failure propagate immediately. Threaded through both the
  Copilot and Claude providers.
- New `POST /api/gate-respond` and `GET /api/gate-status` HTTP API endpoints
  on the web dashboard server. `GET /api/gate-status` returns whether a
  `human_gate` agent is currently waiting, and which agent name it is.
  `POST /api/gate-respond` resolves the parked gate by injecting a
  `GateResponse` into the engine's queue. When the optional
  `CONDUCTOR_GATE_TOKEN` secret is configured on the server, `POST
  /api/gate-respond` requires an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  matching it (compared in constant time) — requests with a missing or
  mismatched token are rejected with HTTP 403. `GET /api/gate-status` is
  unauthenticated. The matching WebSocket `gate_response` path enforces the
  same token and waiting-state checks so it cannot be used to bypass auth.
- New `conductor gate-respond` CLI command for resolving a parked human gate
  from the command line without opening a browser. Accepts `--port`, `--choice`,
  `--agent` (auto-discovered via `/api/gate-status` when omitted), `--input`,
  and `--token` / `CONDUCTOR_GATE_TOKEN` env var. Designed for SSH or headless
  environments where the web dashboard UI is unreachable.
- `script` steps now resolve a bare command name (e.g. `python`) or an
  extension-less path against the executable search path before launching, so
  the binary the shell would pick is the one that runs (and a Windows path
  missing its `.exe`/`.cmd` suffix resolves correctly). Resolution uses the
  subprocess's own `PATH` — including any `env.PATH` override on the step — so
  the resolved binary matches what the child process would execute. Relative
  paths containing a separator are left untouched so they keep resolving against
  `working_dir`, and an unresolvable command falls back to the rendered value so
  the existing not-found error still fires.

### Changed
- **Breaking (Claude provider):** `ClaudeProvider._extract_text_content` now
  returns `{"result": "<text>"}` instead of `{"text": "<text>"}`. This aligns
  the Claude provider with the Copilot provider (cross-provider parity). Any
  existing Claude workflow that references `{{ <agent>.output.text }}` must be
  updated to `{{ <agent>.output.result }}`. Workflows that declare an `output:`
  schema are unaffected (the schema fields take precedence). See the new
  `output_mode: raw` feature if you need to consume unstructured text output
  reliably across both providers.

### Fixed
- `_verbose_console` is now silent-aware at the source: a `_SilentAwareConsole`
  subclass no-ops every `.print(...)` when `is_verbose()` is False, so the
  remaining `conductor --silent` stderr leaks (dashboard-failed-to-start and
  log-file-open warnings, workflow-hash mismatch, "Press Esc to interrupt",
  "Event log written to…", "Log written to…", `_print_resume_instructions`,
  and the replay command's "Press Ctrl+C to exit" / "Replay stopped"
  banners) no longer reach stderr. The app-wide `console` remains
  unchanged because it carries real error messages; the two replay prints
  are gated per-call. `conductor --silent replay <log>` now produces zero
  bytes on stderr
  ([#223](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/223),
  closes [#209](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/209)).
- Parse-exhaustion `ProviderError` (after all in-session recovery attempts
  are spent) is now marked `is_retryable=False` in both Copilot and Claude
  providers. Previously Copilot marked it `is_retryable=True`, causing the
  outer retry loop to re-run the entire agent up to 3× on deterministic
  parse failures — burning tokens with no chance of success.
- Parse-exhaustion error messages now include the first 500 characters of the
  model's response (up from 200) and suggest `output_mode: raw` as a fix.
- `parse_json_output` and the Copilot provider's `_extract_json` now use a
  two-stage fenced-block extraction (non-greedy `re.findall` + per-candidate
  try-parse, then a greedy single-capture fallback) so JSON whose string
  fields contain triple-backtick substrings no longer matches prematurely
  and falls into parse-recovery loops, while responses with multiple
  fenced JSON blocks still pick the first valid one. Resolves a recurring
  failure mode for agents emitting Markdown-bearing JSON
  (external-workflow-friction Issue #1)
  ([#232](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/232)).
- `conductor run --web-bg` and `conductor resume --web-bg` now abort before
  forking when the workflow contains a `human_gate` agent (including gates
  nested in `for_each.agent`) and `--skip-gates` is not set, with a message
  listing the four supported options. `resume --web-bg` also recovers the
  workflow path from the checkpoint when invoked without an explicit
  workflow argument so the guard still fires. Previously the detached
  child crashed with `EOFError` and the parent only reported
  "Background process exited immediately with code 1" (Issue #8).

### Documentation
- New "Choosing whether to declare `output:`" section in
  [docs/workflow-syntax.md](docs/workflow-syntax.md) describing when to declare
  a schema versus consuming raw `<agent>.output.result` for prose or large
  JSON. Closes a documentation gap that contributed to misconfiguration of
  agents emitting large payloads (Issue #2).
- `docs/cli-reference.md` `--web-bg` section now documents the `human_gate`
  incompatibility and the new pre-fork validation behavior.

### Added
- Workflow `limits.budget_usd` and `limits.budget_mode` (`audit` | `enforce`)
  cap cumulative LLM cost across a run. `audit` (default) emits a
  `budget_exceeded` event and continues so users can profile costs before
  enforcing; `enforce` saves a checkpoint and stops with
  `BudgetExceededError`. Resuming with `conductor resume` starts a fresh
  budget window (cumulative spend resets to $0), so the remaining work runs
  under a full budget — raising `budget_usd` first is optional. Sub-workflow
  spend is merged into the parent so a parent budget accounts for delegated
  cost. Schema, engine enforcement at all five existing limit-check points,
  resume parity for restored budget state, and the new `BudgetExceededError`
  type are wired end-to-end. See
  [docs/workflow-syntax.md](docs/workflow-syntax.md#cost-budget) and
  [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the graduation path.

## [0.1.17](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.16...v0.1.17) - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Script agents can now declare an `output:` schema using the same
  OutputField syntax as LLM agents. When declared, the engine parses
  stdout as JSON and validates it against the schema before emitting
  `script_completed`; missing fields, wrong types, non-JSON stdout,
  empty stdout, and JSON arrays/scalars all raise `ValidationError` and
  emit `script_failed` (with stdout/stderr/exit_code) instead of
  completing. Validation runs on the **merged** output dict so declared
  `stdout` / `stderr` / `exit_code` fields validate the value
  downstream actually sees (matching the PR #122 shadowing contract).
  An explicit `output: {}` opts into strict JSON-object mode with zero
  required fields. Without a declared schema, the legacy best-effort
  JSON-stdout auto-merge from PR #122 is fully preserved, so this is
  purely additive. Routing conditions can now reference declared fields
  (e.g. `when: "phase == 'planning'"`) rather than opaque exit codes
  ([#206](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/206),
  [#118](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/118)).
- `conductor validate` now warns on undeclared `agent.output` references
  and field-level mismatches in `explicit` context mode, closing two
  follow-up gaps left by PR #125 that still produced the runtime
  `TemplateError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'X'` from issue #105.
  The validator now tracks declared fields per agent root (`a.output.foo`
  vs `a.output.bar`), so a prompt that references an undeclared field on
  an otherwise-declared agent surfaces a warning instead of a runtime
  failure; the same logic applies to static parallel groups
  (`pg.outputs.member.field`). Output-vs-error namespaces are tracked
  independently so `input: ["pg.errors"]` no longer silently suppresses
  warnings for `{{ pg.outputs.* }}` references, and the AST walker now
  filters inner-link `Getattr` nodes (no more spurious whole-output
  refs from `{{ a.output.bar }}` chains), detects method-call nodes
  (`{% for k,v in a.output.items() %}` registers as a whole-output ref),
  and degrades gracefully on `TemplateAssertionError`. For-each groups
  remain skipped (whole-member copy makes field precision a false
  positive); `human_gate` is now correctly excluded from `agent.output`
  warnings since the engine renders gate prompts in accumulate mode
  ([#208](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/208), refs #105).

### Changed
- Copilot provider verbose log lines (tool calls, reasoning, processing
  indicators, idle/parse recovery) are now prefixed with the originating
  agent name in parallel and for-each runs, eliminating the
  un-attributable interleaved output that made the for-each case
  unreadable (every iteration previously shared the same agent name).
  An optional `agent_name` parameter is plumbed through
  `_execute_sdk_call` → `_send_and_wait` → `_log_event_verbose` and
  rendered as a magenta `[agent_name]` tag between the tree icon and
  event content (continuation lines tagged too). For-each iterations
  additionally get a `model_copy()` of the per-iteration agent with
  `name = f"{name}[{key}]"` so each iteration produces a distinct tag;
  the original `AgentDef` is untouched and context lookups still use
  the unqualified name. Static parallel groups are unaffected — each
  agent already has a unique name. The `_item_callback` merge order is
  flipped so the wrapper's `agent_name`/`item_key` win over any
  qualified name the provider emits, preserving the dashboard/JSONL
  event contract (`agent_name` = for-each group name; `item_key`
  disambiguates iterations). Backward compatible: `agent_name` defaults
  to `None` for sequential agents
  ([#207](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/207), closes #16).

### Fixed
- `conductor resume … --web` and `--web-bg` no longer open an empty
  dashboard. Checkpoints now record the original `run_id` and JSONL
  `event_log_path`. On resume the dashboard's history is seeded BEFORE
  it accepts clients: the CLI prepends a fresh `workflow_started` event
  built from the current YAML (so historical events apply to the
  correct topology), then replays the original JSONL log line-by-line
  (or, when no log file is available, synthesises minimal
  `*_started`/`*_completed` pairs from the restored execution history).
  The resumed engine's own `workflow_started` emit is suppressed so the
  dashboard sees exactly one root start — no `wfDepth` double-counting.
  Root-level `workflow_completed` / `workflow_failed` /
  `checkpoint_saved` events from the original run are filtered out on
  replay; subworkflow lifecycle events are preserved so the frontend's
  context tracking stays balanced. The resumed `EventLogSubscriber`
  appends to the original log, preserving `run_id` across resume
  generations so log/timeline correlation tools see one continuous run
  (#167).
- `--web-bg` startup crashes on Windows are no longer silent
  ([#116](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/116)). Three
  changes work together to make any crash forensically traceable:
  - `conductor.cli.bg_runner` now captures the detached child's stdout
    and stderr to log files in `$TMPDIR/conductor/` (named to match the
    existing `.events.jsonl` filename) instead of discarding them with
    `subprocess.DEVNULL`. A Python traceback or `faulthandler` dump from
    the child now survives the parent's exit. The captured stderr path
    is printed alongside the dashboard URL and is included in every
    background-launch failure message so users always know where to
    look.
  - `conductor/__init__.py` enables `faulthandler` at import time
    (writing to `sys.__stderr__`), so a native crash — segfault, abort,
    fatal Python error — dumps a Python-level stack trace into the
    captured stderr log.
  - `WorkflowEngine._execute_loop` now catches `BaseException` (in
    addition to the existing `KeyboardInterrupt` / `ConductorError` /
    `Exception` arms) and emits a `workflow_failed` event with
    `is_base_exception: true` before re-raising. A bare `SystemExit` or
    other non-`Exception` failure between `agent_started` and
    `agent_prompt_rendered` now leaves a structured failure event in the
    JSONL log instead of an unexplained two-event truncation. An
    explicit `except asyncio.CancelledError: raise` arm sits in front of
    it so a normal dashboard-stop or parent cancellation is not
    mis-reported as an unexpected failure.
  Two new env vars (`CONDUCTOR_RUN_ID`, `CONDUCTOR_BG_STDERR_LOG`,
  `CONDUCTOR_BG_STDOUT_LOG`) propagate the parent-chosen run id and log
  paths to the child so the bg log files and the child's events JSONL
  share an 8-hex run id in their filenames, and `workflow_started`
  system metadata surfaces both bg log paths to the dashboard. The root
  cause of the underlying intermittent Windows crash is still pending —
  this change makes it diagnosable rather than invisible.

- Workflows that configure `reasoning.effort` (or workflow-wide
  `runtime.default_reasoning_effort`) on the Copilot provider were broken
  for **every named Copilot model** when running against
  `github-copilot-sdk` 0.3.0. The SDK's `models.list` response includes a
  `billing` object on every model, but none of them currently ship the
  `multiplier` field that the SDK's `ModelBilling.from_dict` parser
  treats as required — so every model in the response triggers
  `ValueError("Missing required field 'multiplier' in ModelBilling")`,
  which kills the entire `list_models()` call. The error then leaked
  through the narrow `except` tuple in
  `_validate_reasoning_effort_for_model` (and `get_max_prompt_tokens`),
  poisoned the retry loop, and surfaced as `Dialog turn failed: …` after
  three wasted attempts. (`get_max_prompt_tokens` was rescued by the
  engine's outer `except Exception`, so context-window metadata was
  silently unavailable rather than fatal.)
  Both metadata methods now catch any `Exception` raised at the SDK
  boundary and treat the failure as "metadata unavailable" — validation
  is skipped permissively and the configured `reasoning_effort` is
  forwarded to `create_session` as before.
  `asyncio.CancelledError`/`KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit` (all
  `BaseException` subclasses) still propagate.
- `conductor resume --web-bg` (and `--web`) no longer exit silently when
  a workflow exceeds `max_iterations`. The bg child was forked with
  `--no-interactive` and `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`, so when the engine
  hit the limit, `IntPrompt.ask` raised `EOFError`, got coerced to `0`
  (stop), and the workflow ended with no way to recover. The
  max-iterations gate can now be resolved from the dashboard. New
  resolution policy: `skip_gates` auto-stops (unchanged); no web
  dashboard uses the legacy CLI prompt (unchanged); web dashboard +
  bg/non-TTY stdin uses a **web-only** wait (the CLI prompt is
  deliberately NOT raced because it would synchronously `EOFError` and
  win every dashboard click), with `dashboard.wait_for_stop()` racing
  so `POST /api/stop` can terminate the wait when no dashboard tab is
  open; web dashboard + TTY foreground races CLI vs web. Each
  `iteration_limit_reached` payload carries a uuid4 `gate_id` that the
  dashboard must echo back in `iteration_limit_response`, and the
  server matches/discards stale responses so a delayed double-click
  cannot be misapplied to a later gate. `iteration_limit_resolved`
  includes the same `gate_id` so subscribers can correlate the pair.
  New top-level `IterationLimitModal` (parallel-group gates can't
  attach to a per-agent panel) shows iteration count, recent agent
  history, and number input; it is hidden when `skip_gates` is true
  and does not close on Escape so the workflow can't be accidentally
  orphaned ([#202](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/202),
  fixes #198).
- `conductor run --web-bg` and `conductor resume --web-bg` no longer
  get killed within ~10 seconds when launched from a shell wrapper
  that runs commands inside a Windows job object with
  `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` (GitHub Actions runners, VS Code
  integrated terminal, JetBrains IDE terminals, GitHub Copilot CLI
  shell tool). The detached child previously inherited the parent's
  job and died with it; users saw a dashboard URL but the workflow
  never made progress. The `Popen` call now requests
  `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` in addition to
  `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` so the child fully detaches. In hardened
  CI environments that clear `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK`,
  `CreateProcess` raises `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`; in that case a visible
  stderr warning is emitted (so the user understands bg mode may not
  survive shell exit) and the spawn is retried without the breakaway
  flag. Other `OSError`s propagate unchanged so the existing
  `RuntimeError` wrapper still surfaces them cleanly. Refactors the
  two near-identical detachment+Popen blocks in `launch_background`
  and `launch_background_resume` into a single `_spawn_detached`
  helper; constants are resolved via `getattr` so the module remains
  importable on POSIX hosts and tests can patch `sys.platform` to
  `"win32"` from Linux/macOS
  ([#200](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/200)).
- `conductor run --web-bg --log-file auto` now produces a log file
  with a real provider-side trace. `bg_runner.launch_background()` /
  `launch_background_resume()` already redirect the child's
  stdout/stderr/stdin to `subprocess.DEVNULL`, so silence is enforced
  at the OS level — but they also passed `--silent` to the child,
  which flipped `verbose_mode=False` and gated more than console
  prints (the Copilot provider's `_log_event_verbose()`,
  `_log_parse_recovery()`, and `_log_recovery_attempt()` all became
  no-ops, dropping events from the log file too). Both synthesized
  commands now omit `--silent`; console output still goes to DEVNULL
  via the Popen kwargs. Side benefit: the synthesized command is now
  reproducible by hand without learning that `--silent` was being
  injected behind the scenes
  ([#199](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/199),
  [#196](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/issues/196)).
- `--web-bg` and other `--silent` invocations no longer leak the
  dashboard URL banner to stdout. Several `console.print` /
  `typer.echo` calls in `cli/run.py` were unconditionally writing the
  bg-launch URL, stderr log path, and `conductor stop` hint even with
  `--silent` / `is_verbose() == False`. Remaining unguarded URL prints
  are now gated behind `is_verbose()` so `--silent` is honored end to
  end ([#203](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/203),
  [#211](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/211)).
- `conductor validate <registry-workflow>` now succeeds for workflows
  that `conductor run` already executed successfully. The validator's
  `_resolve_subworkflow_ref_for_validation` was missing the step that
  the engine's `_resolve_subworkflow_path` already had: when a parent
  workflow lives inside a registry SHA cache and references a sibling
  via a relative path (e.g. `../document-review/workflow.yaml`), the
  engine auto-fetches the sibling from the same registry+SHA cache via
  `auto_fetch_relative_workflow`. The validator only checked the
  filesystem and reported "sub-workflow file not found". Validation and
  execution now agree on which refs are resolvable
  ([#197](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/197)).
- Registry cache now mirrors the source repository layout so
  repo-relative references between workflows in the same registry repo
  resolve correctly. Previously each workflow was isolated under
  `<base>/<registry>/<workflow_name>/<sha[:12]>/<filename>`, so
  `sdd-plan/plan.yaml` referencing `../document-review/workflow.yaml`
  resolved to a path that never existed in the cache and forced manual
  workarounds. The cache now stores workflows from the same
  registry+SHA under a shared per-SHA root
  (`<base>/<registry>/<sha[:12]>/<repo_path>`); metadata lives in a
  sibling `_meta/<sha[:12]>/` tree so it can never collide with real
  repo paths (e.g. a repo's own `.conductor/` directory). Per-workflow
  readiness sentinels are written **last** so readers never observe a
  partially populated workflow; per-file `os.replace()` stays
  intra-filesystem for atomic promotion; `_safe_repo_path()` rejects
  `..`, absolute paths, NUL bytes, and empty paths from any
  index/sibling entry; `_resolve_within()` adds defense-in-depth that
  resolved targets stay under the SHA root; `source.json` carries
  `cache_layout_version`, `registry_type`, `source`, and `full_sha` so
  cache hits require all four to match (stale metadata triggers
  re-fetch); the registry index is cached on disk so cache hits avoid
  a network round-trip. Sub-workflow refs from the same registry are
  auto-fetched when not yet present (gated to file-path-looking
  candidates with no `@`). `add_registry()` now rejects names
  containing `/`, `\`, the empty string, or the reserved `_adhoc` /
  `_meta` namespaces
  ([#194](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/194)).

## [0.1.16](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.15...v0.1.16) - 2026-05-14

### Added
- `type: workflow` agents now accept registry references
  (`workflow[@registry][#ref]`) in the `workflow:` field, not just local file
  paths. Resolution prefers a local file when one exists relative to the
  parent workflow directory (preserves backward compatibility for
  extensionless local refs); otherwise the value is parsed as a registry
  reference, fetched via the registry cache, and executed from the cached
  location. `conductor validate` now recursively validates fetched
  sub-workflows with cycle detection (inode-based identity, so case-variant
  paths on macOS/Windows collapse correctly) and a depth cap of 10 — when
  the cap is hit a warning surfaces so users know validation was truncated
  rather than silently clean. Mutable registry refs (`name@registry#main`,
  or no `#ref`) may resolve to a different commit on `conductor resume` if
  the upstream branch has moved; pinned tags or commit SHAs guarantee
  deterministic resume
  ([#188](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/188)).
- Conductor now ships as a Claude Code plugin marketplace at the repo root.
  Users can install the conductor skill directly from `microsoft/conductor`
  with `/plugin marketplace add microsoft/conductor` followed by
  `/plugin install conductor@conductor`. The plugin ships markdown only
  (no `bin/`, hooks, MCP servers, or executables), keeping the trust
  surface minimal. The same `SKILL.md` remains usable via
  `gh skill install microsoft/conductor conductor` for Copilot CLI users.
  The previous `.claude/skills/conductor` location was removed — the
  plugin is now the single home for the skill; for local development on
  the skill itself, use `claude --plugin-dir plugins/conductor`
  ([#186](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/186)).

### Changed
- The bundled Conductor skill (`SKILL.md` + references) was refreshed to
  reflect the current CLI, schema, and feature set: `show` / `replay` /
  `--metadata` / `--workspace-instructions` quick-reference entries; new
  `type: workflow`, `dialog`, `retry`, `hooks`, `metadata`, `instructions`,
  `timeout_seconds`, and `openai-agents` provider concepts; corrected
  `update` behavior (default prints the install-script one-liner,
  `--apply` launches the installer); `CONDUCTOR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`;
  registry `latest = branch HEAD` and `#ref` syntax; sub-workflow agents
  and dialog mode authoring guidance; script JSON-stdout auto-merge;
  `workflow.dir` / `workflow.file` template variables; and unknown-fields
  rejection in schema validation
  ([#187](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/187)).
- README "Why Conductor?" rewritten around three pillars — repeatable
  execution, deterministic routing, and version-controlled YAML
  workflows — and now leads with the real differentiator (zero-token
  orchestration) using concrete use-case examples
  ([#185](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/185)).

## [0.1.15](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.14...v0.1.15) - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Per-agent `timeout_seconds` field for hard wall-clock timeouts on agent
  execution. Wraps execution in `asyncio.wait_for()` at the engine level so a
  slow agent no longer blocks the rest of the workflow. Effective timeout is
  `min(agent.timeout_seconds, remaining_workflow_timeout)` — when the workflow
  timeout is stricter it owns the error so attribution is never mislabeled.
  Raises a new `AgentTimeoutError` (subclass of `TimeoutError`) honored by
  existing `fail_fast` / `continue_on_error` semantics in parallel and
  for-each groups, and emits an `agent_timeout` event (with elapsed time
  and limit) for console + dashboard subscribers. Scoped to provider-backed
  agents; rejected on `script`, `human_gate`, and `workflow` types
  ([#150](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/150)).
- Auto-discovery of `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` workspace
  conventions, matching GitHub Copilot's documented semantics. Files marked
  `applyTo: "**"` in their frontmatter are loaded into the workspace preamble
  alongside `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md`;
  scoped (`applyTo: "<glob>"`) and absent-`applyTo` files are skipped per
  the convention's manual-attach default. The internal
  `CONVENTION_FILES: list[str]` table is refactored to a polymorphic
  `CONVENTIONS: list[Convention]` (`ConventionFile | ConventionDirectory`)
  so adding new conventions (Cursor rules, Cline rules, etc.) becomes one
  filter function plus one list entry; a `CONVENTION_FILES` module-level
  alias preserves backward compatibility for downstream imports
  ([#169](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/169)).

### Fixed
- `agent.system_prompt` is now rendered and forwarded to providers. The
  executor was rendering `agent.system_prompt` only to discard the result
  (`_ = self.renderer.render(...)`), so providers that forward
  `system_prompt` — notably the Copilot provider, which concatenates it
  into the prompt — received the un-rendered Jinja template. Agents whose
  instructions lived in `system_prompt` sent literal `{{ ... }}` placeholders
  to the model and got back "the prompt template contains unfilled variables"
  refusals. Also adds a `conductor validate` warning for agents that define
  `system_prompt` but no `prompt:` (a portability hazard since the Claude
  provider drops `system_prompt` entirely, and almost always a missing-`prompt:`
  typo) ([#179](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/179)).
- `conductor update` on Windows no longer attempts an in-process self-upgrade.
  The previous flow tried to re-install into the same venv the running
  `python.exe` lives in, producing "Access is denied" failures that earlier
  mitigations only papered over. `conductor update` now checks for a newer
  version and prints the OS-appropriate `install.ps1` / `install.sh`
  one-liner, and the install scripts become the single upgrade path: they
  detect other running conductor processes (auto-stopping under `-Yes`),
  sweep stale `*.exe.old` files, retry with backoff (2s / 5s / 10s), and —
  when uv can't remove the `conductor-cli` tool dir because of file locks —
  rename the whole dir aside and retry. `install.sh` reaches parity with
  `--yes` / `--force` / `--source` flags, retry-with-backoff, running-process
  detection, and a post-install `conductor --version` verify
  ([#171](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/171)).
- `install.ps1` is now stored without a UTF-8 BOM. The documented one-liner
  `irm https://aka.ms/conductor/install.ps1 | iex` returns the script body
  as a single string with the BOM surviving as U+FEFF at index 0; PowerShell's
  in-memory `iex` parser then trips on the `[CmdletBinding()]` attribute with
  `Unexpected attribute 'CmdletBinding'`. Both fresh installs via `irm | iex`
  and `conductor update --apply` (which re-runs the same command in a
  spawned console) now succeed. Direct `powershell.exe -File install.ps1`
  invocations were unaffected, which is why prior file-based integration
  tests didn't catch it ([#178](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/178)).
- `conductor stop` (including `--all` and `--port`) no longer crashes on
  Windows when a PID file exists in `~/.conductor/runs/`. The Unix idiom
  `os.kill(pid, 0)` for liveness probing is *not* a no-op on Windows — any
  signal other than `CTRL_C_EVENT` / `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` routes through
  `TerminateProcess` and can raise `OSError` subclasses outside
  `ProcessLookupError` / `PermissionError` (e.g. `WinError 11 /
  ERROR_BAD_FORMAT`), and even "successful" calls would actually terminate
  the target with exit code 0. `_is_process_alive()` now dispatches to a
  Windows-specific implementation using `OpenProcess` +
  `GetExitCodeProcess` for a truly non-destructive liveness check
  ([#176](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/176)).

## [0.1.14](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.13...v0.1.14) - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `conductor update` no longer reports its own launching shim as another
  running Conductor process. On Windows the `conductor.exe` shim is a
  separate process from the Python interpreter that runs the update
  command, so excluding only `os.getpid()` caused a false "1 other
  Conductor process is running" warning. The check now walks the full
  ancestor PID chain (via `wmic` on Windows, `ps` elsewhere) and excludes
  every process along the way, falling back to `{getpid(), getppid()}`
  if the parent map cannot be built.
  [#164](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/164)

## [0.1.13](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.12...v0.1.13) - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `conductor resume` is now at flag parity with `conductor run`. New flags:
  `--provider` / `-p` (runtime provider override), `--metadata` / `-m` (CLI
  metadata merged on top of YAML metadata), `--web` (real-time dashboard for
  the resumed run), `--web-port`, and `--web-bg` (fork a detached resume +
  dashboard process). `--web` and `--web-bg` are mutually exclusive, matching
  `run`. The dashboard only shows events from the resumed agent forward —
  agent runs that completed before the checkpoint were emitted in the original
  process and are not replayed. `--input`, `--workspace-instructions`,
  `--instructions`, and `--dry-run` are intentionally not mirrored
  ([#158](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/158)).
- Reasoning effort (`low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh`) is now displayed in
  the web dashboard under each agent's metadata, right after `Model`. Effective
  value is per-agent `reasoning.effort` if set, otherwise
  `runtime.default_reasoning_effort`, otherwise omitted. Backed by a new
  `reasoning_effort` field on the `workflow_started` event payload, so older
  event log JSONL files replay gracefully (the row simply doesn't render)
  ([#160](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/160)).
- New `iteration_limit_reached` and `iteration_limit_resolved` events are
  emitted when a workflow hits its `max_iterations` cap. Previously the
  console showed an interactive `IntPrompt` while the web dashboard went
  silently dark; the dashboard now renders the prompt state and the chosen
  resolution. The `iteration_limit_reached` payload includes a `possible_loop`
  heuristic flag (set when the last 3 history entries are the same agent) so
  subscribers can call out stuck review loops
  ([#162](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/162)).

### Changed
- Workflow registry references now resolve `latest` (and bare `name@registry`
  refs) to the **default branch HEAD** instead of the newest git tag.
  Previously, the moment a registry repo got its first tag, bare references
  silently froze at that tag and stopped picking up commits to `main`. Tags
  remain first-class — pin explicitly via `workflow#v1.2.3` for releases. Also
  saves one GitHub API call on the hot path of bare-name fetches
  ([#157](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/157)).

### Fixed
- Schema validation now rejects unknown fields on `AgentDef`, `ParallelGroup`,
  `ForEachDef`, and `WorkflowConfig` instead of silently dropping them.
  Misnesting `parallel:` or `for_each:` inside an `agents:` item — or typos
  like `prmpt:` — used to fall through to a runtime
  `Model "gpt-4o" is not available` error three layers downstream. They now
  fail at parse time with a clear Pydantic error pointing at the offending
  location. `conductor validate` also gained "Parallel Groups" and "For-each
  Groups" rows in its summary table so missing groups are immediately visible
  ([#159](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/159)).
- Tool arguments and results are now pretty-printed in dashboard / JSONL /
  verbose-console events. Copilot tool results no longer leak the full
  `Result(content=..., contents=None, detailed_content=..., kind=None)` repr
  with literal `\\n` escapes and doubled `\\\\` Windows paths, and tool
  arguments render as JSON (`{"k": "v"}`) instead of Python dict repr
  (`{'k': 'v'}`). Both providers share a new
  `src/conductor/providers/_event_format.py` helper for parity
  ([#161](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/161)).
- `install.ps1` on Windows now captures full `uv tool install` stdout AND
  stderr via `Start-Process -RedirectStandardOutput -RedirectStandardError`
  to temp files. Previously, with `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`,
  PowerShell treated uv's stderr as a terminating error and threw before
  the assignment completed, so install failures showed `(no output captured)`
  with no way to diagnose them
  ([#156](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/156)).

## [0.1.12](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.11...v0.1.12) - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Unified `reasoning.effort` configuration for per-agent and workflow-wide
  control of model reasoning / extended-thinking effort. Set
  `runtime.default_reasoning_effort` (`low` | `medium` | `high` | `xhigh`) for a
  workflow-wide default, or override per agent with a `reasoning.effort` block.
  Translates to `reasoning_effort` on the Copilot session and to extended
  `thinking` budget on Claude (low=2048, medium=8192, high=16384, xhigh=32768
  tokens, with `temperature` coerced to 1.0 and `max_tokens` bumped to fit).
  Validates against each model's supported efforts/capabilities and surfaces
  thinking content via `agent_reasoning` events. See
  [`examples/reasoning-effort.yaml`](examples/reasoning-effort.yaml)
  ([#152](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/152)).
- Tag-based versioning for the workflow registry. Versions are now
  auto-discovered from git tags instead of being explicitly listed in
  `registry.yaml`, and refs accept any tag, branch, or SHA via the new
  `workflow#ref` syntax (e.g. `sdd/plan#v3.0.0`, `sdd/plan#main`,
  `sdd/plan#abc1234`). Stale CDN content is bypassed via cache-busting
  query parameters so registry updates are visible immediately
  ([#151](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/151)).

### Fixed
- `conductor update` reliability on Windows. Adds a pre-flight check for
  other running Conductor processes (which hold file locks on
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\tools\conductor-cli\` and cause `uv tool install
  --force` to fail with "Access is denied"), retries the install up to 3
  times to absorb transient Windows Defender failures, surfaces full uv
  stdout AND stderr on failure with Defender-exclusion guidance, broadens
  the Windows entrypoint rename to cover the uv tool venv `Scripts/`
  directory in `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and `%APPDATA%`, and adds a new
  `conductor update --force` flag to skip the pre-flight check
  ([#155](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/155)).
- Dashboard layout for workflows with `human_gate` options or multiple
  loop-back routes (e.g. revision loops). The `workflow_started` event now
  emits routes from `human_gate` `options[].route` so gate edges aren't
  silently dropped, and the frontend pre-classifies back-edges via DFS from
  `$start` and feeds them to Dagre in reversed direction so cycles no
  longer scramble rank assignment. Workflows like `sdd/plan-v3.yaml` now
  render as a coherent top-to-bottom DAG instead of disconnected columns
  with long diagonal edges
  ([#153](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/153)).
- Windows install failures now surface useful diagnostics. `install.ps1`
  prints captured `uv` stdout/stderr on failure instead of swallowing it,
  and uses the correct Microsoft Defender cmdlet so the install path is
  exclusion-friendly ([#149](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/149)).

## [0.1.11](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.10...v0.1.11) - 2026-05-04

### Added
- `metadata` dict on workflow definitions, settable statically in YAML or
  dynamically via `--metadata` / `-m` CLI flags. Merged metadata is
  included in the `workflow_started` event for downstream consumers
  ([#107](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/107)).
- `input_mapping` field on `type: workflow` agents, enabling Jinja2-templated
  per-call inputs to sub-workflows evaluated against the parent context.
  When omitted, the parent's `workflow.input.*` is forwarded as before
  ([#109](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/109)).
- `type: workflow` agents are now allowed inside `for_each` groups, enabling
  dynamic fan-out to sub-workflows with per-iteration `input_mapping`. Each
  iteration emits its own `subworkflow_started` / `subworkflow_completed`
  events ([#110](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/110)).
- Self-referential sub-workflows are now allowed; depth is bounded by the
  global `MAX_SUBWORKFLOW_DEPTH` plus an optional per-agent `max_depth`
  field on `AgentDef` ([#111](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/111)).
- `workflow.dir`, `workflow.file`, and `workflow.name` template variables are
  now available in all agent contexts (regardless of context mode). Lets
  registry-hosted workflows reference co-located scripts and assets without
  depending on the caller's working directory
  ([#121](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/121)).
- Script agent stdout that is valid JSON is auto-parsed and merged into
  the agent's output dict alongside `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exit_code`,
  enabling field-based `when:` route conditions instead of opaque exit-code
  matching ([#122](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/122)).
- `conductor validate` now performs semantic validation in addition to
  YAML schema checks, catching stale agent references, missing workflow
  inputs, and undeclared explicit-mode dependencies before runtime in
  `prompt`, `system_prompt`, `command`, `args`, `working_dir`,
  `input_mapping`, parallel-group inputs, and workflow `output:`
  templates ([#125](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/125)).
- Web dashboard: breadcrumb navigation, double-click dive-in to
  sub-workflow graphs, isolated subworkflow contexts (no node-status
  bleed across repeated runs), and reliable Stop button during
  subworkflows ([#113](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/113),
  follow-up fixes in [#146](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/146)).
- Dialog mode for agents: multi-turn conversational interactions
  driven by a `dialog` gate with conditional transitions, full
  Copilot and Claude provider support, and dedicated dashboard UI
  (`DialogDetail`, `DialogEngagementPrompt`, `DialogOverlay`)
  ([#130](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/130)).
- Markdown rendering and auto-linkification in human gate prompts.
  Gate prompts render through Rich Markdown in the terminal and as
  GitHub-Flavored Markdown in the dashboard. Bare file paths and URLs
  in gate prompts are converted to clickable links; relative paths
  open a sandboxed `FileViewer` modal served via a path-traversal-safe
  `GET /api/files/{path}` endpoint
  ([#131](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/131)).
- Workspace instructions support: `--workspace-instructions` and
  `--instructions` CLI flags plus a YAML-level `instructions:` field on
  the workflow. Auto-discovers `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` by walking from CWD to the git root,
  prepends them to every agent's prompt, inherits into sub-workflows,
  and persists in checkpoints
  ([#141](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/141)).

### Changed
- The dashboard's "context window remaining" bar now sources
  `context_window_max` from each provider's SDK at runtime instead of a
  hand-maintained static table. Values now reflect the actual cap the SDK
  enforces (e.g. `claude-opus-4.6` reports 200K rather than the theoretical
  1M; `gpt-5.x` reports 128K rather than 400K). The `context_window` field
  on `ModelPricing` has been removed; pricing data continues to be
  hand-maintained for cost calculation only
  ([#144](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/144)).

### Fixed
- Pass `streaming=True` to the Copilot SDK's `create_session` to prevent
  silent truncation of large tool-call arguments. In non-streaming mode
  the model's per-turn output budget is exhausted mid-JSON for large
  arguments (e.g., `create` with multi-KB `file_text`), the CLI executes
  the partial tool call, and the agent loops on the broken call until
  the wall-clock session limit fires ([#129](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/129)).
- Build the Copilot prompt schema recursively from nested `output:`
  definitions instead of flattening to top-level fields only. Nested object
  properties, required keys, and array item schemas are now included in the
  prompt-facing schema used for initial guidance and parse recovery
  ([#100](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/100)).
- Coerce Python literal `"True"` / `"False"` / `"None"` strings produced by
  Jinja's default `str(bool)` rendering into native Python types when
  building workflow output. Previously, `output: { matched: "{{ a == b }}" }`
  produced the string `"False"` (truthy), causing downstream `when:`
  comparisons against `false` to silently misbehave
  ([#139](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/139)).
- Pricing fuzzy match no longer silently inherits values across model
  families. Names sharing a textual prefix with a known key (e.g.
  `claude-opus-4.7` previously matched `claude-opus-4`) now require a `-`
  delimiter; non-matching names return `None` and the dashboard hides the
  cost field. A one-time warning is emitted per requested name on any
  non-exact match ([#143](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/143)).
- Run `uv tool update-shell` after `uv tool install` in both `install.ps1`
  and `install.sh` so `conductor` is available on PATH in new shells, CI
  agents, and IDE extensions after a fresh install
  ([#142](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/142)).
- In explicit context mode, `workflow.input` is now always available to
  `script` and `type: workflow` agent templates regardless of the agent's
  declared `input:` list. The explicit-mode contract still applies to LLM
  agents (no undeclared inputs in prompts to control token cost)
  ([#119](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/119)).
- Optional workflow inputs without an explicit `default:` now resolve to
  type-appropriate zero values (`""`, `0`, `false`, `[]`, `{}`) instead of
  Python `None`, so templates like
  `{{ workflow.input.optional | default("fallback") }}` render the fallback
  rather than the literal string `"None"`
  ([#123](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/123)).
- Web dashboard: events without an engine-supplied `subworkflow_path`
  stamp (e.g., `for_each_item_started` for a parent for_each over
  `type: workflow` agents) now route strictly to the root context
  instead of falling back to the user's currently-viewed path. This
  fixes two related symptoms: dashboards opened during a run with
  sub-workflows no longer auto-land inside an iteration, and a parent
  for_each panel now displays every iteration rather than silently
  dropping the middle ones into a sibling sub-workflow's context
  ([#148](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/148)).

## [0.1.10](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/compare/v0.1.9...v0.1.10) - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Sub-workflow composition support: `workflow`-type agents can now be used
  inside `for_each` groups, with dynamic per-iteration `input_mapping`
  ([#101](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/101), [#102](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/102)).

### Changed
- Bumped `github-copilot-sdk` to `>=0.3.0`. The SDK ships a bundled `copilot`
  CLI binary used for JSON-RPC `session.create` calls; `0.2.2` bundled CLI
  `1.0.21`, which rejected newer model IDs locally with
  `JSON-RPC -32603: Model "<id>" is not available`. `0.3.0` bundles CLI
  `1.0.36-0`, which accepts the current Copilot model catalog (including
  `claude-opus-4.7*` variants).

### Fixed
- Suppressed noisy PowerShell stderr output from `uv tool install` during
  Windows self-update ([#99](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/pull/99)).
